# Datasets

The table below summarieses all the datasets used. To obtain any of the datasets, use the corresponding link.

- `/annotations`, contains the annotations for each dataset. I am not permitted to upload/share the annotations as they were obtained from Rayson Laroca, one of the authors of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01754), and is only available upon request directly from the author(s) of the paper, however, some datasets include the annotations when downloaded.
- `/class_names`, contains the class names used.
- `visualise_dataset.ipynb`, used to visualise and check the datasets with the image annotations/labels.
- `datasets_utils.py`, provides utility functions to operate on the datasets.
- `darknet_dataset_preperations.ipynb`, used to make all datasets compatible with the darknet framework to be used with YOLOv4.
- `data_generator.py`, used to generate new samples using various methods.
- `data_generation.ipynb`, applies what `data_generator.py` provides.
- `Automold.py` and `Helpers.py` are from this [repository](https://github.com/UjjwalSaxena/Automold--Road-Augmentation-Library). They are used in the data generation process.

## To label a dataset (specifically for vehicle/LP detection and recognition):

- Use this [repo](https://github.com/RedaAlb/labelImg).
- Two videos were made demonstrating how the labelling is done:
    - [Part 1 video](https://youtu.be/5tF9a6q4pDQ)
    - [Part 2 video](https://youtu.be/YAxl1udnBqI)
    - There are two parts since the maximum upload video duration is 15 minutes.
